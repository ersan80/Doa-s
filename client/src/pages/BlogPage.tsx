                            When it comes to Turkish coffee, one element instantly distinguishes a good cup from a
                            great one: the foam. A rich, velvety foam sitting on top of the tiny porcelain cup is not
                            just a mark of quality, but also a reflection of tradition and skill. For centuries, coffee
                            lovers have believed that the foam is a sign of both the brewer’s respect for the ritual and
                            the care taken in the preparation. But what really makes the perfect Turkish coffee foam,
                            and how can you achieve it at home?

                            In Turkish culture, the foam is more than just aesthetics — it’s a symbol of hospitality
                            and mastery. Serving a cup without foam is often considered impolite or careless. The foam
                            adds texture to the first sip, locking in the aroma of freshly ground coffee and creating a
                            luxurious experience.

                            Foam is directly connected to the freshness of the beans. Pre-ground or stale coffee won’t
                            produce the same richness. Turkish coffee should be ground extremely fine, almost like
                            powder.
