One cezve, a few curious colleagues, and a love for coffee that refused to stay ordinary. We brewed the first pot right there slow, quiet, aromatic. Before long, the whole floor smelled of roasted beans and shared stories.

Curiosity took over. We began experimenting with beans Sumatra, Ethiopia, and more comparing aromas, foam, and texture. Every brew taught us something new about balance, patience, and flavor. What began as a short break slowly turned into our favorite part of the day.

Thatâ€™s where DoAâ€™s Cezve was born from a simple office ritual to a craft we now share with the world.

Roasted in Austin, inspired by tradition, and brewed with the same spirit that once gathered friends around a cezve.

Today, we still keep that promise: every bag is roasted in small batches and ground to order, so your cup tastes as alive as the moment itâ€™s brewed.

Because Turkish coffee deserves to be fresh and every cezve deserves a story.`}
